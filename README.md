# 8080 (?) Designers Kit (?)
It seems to be a Z80 based, CP/M running computer, with FDD support, and RS232 serial interface. And a test board with 8085 CPU (although it is branded by '8080')

This is the set of cards I found inside:

## Simple Riser Card

Seems to be the heart of the machine.
With:
- Z80 CPU,
- 64k RAM,
- 2k ROM.
The ROM mentions CP/M 2.2
